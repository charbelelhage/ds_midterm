1- Pull the code folder from github.

2- Install Docker from https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/ and follow the steps

3- After successfully installing docker, Open the terminal then pull the ros:noetic image to your environement using :   "docker pull ros:noetic"

4- Run a container based on ros:noetic image using: "docker run -it -v /home/idealworks/Desktop/rosbags:/rosbags -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix --name display_rosbag -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -p 8000:8000 7b56a2c6b724"
"-v /home/idealworks/Desktop/rosbags:/rosbags": Mounts the directory 
"/home/idealworks/Desktop/rosbags" on the host machine to the directory (This directory contains the application file)
"/rosbags" inside the container. 
This allows sharing files between the host and the container.

"-v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix": Mounts the X11 Unix socket directory on the host machine to the same directory inside the container. 
This enables the container to access the host's X11 server and display GUI applications.

"--name display_rosbag": Assigns the name "display_rosbag" to the container.


"-e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY": Sets the DISPLAY environment variable inside the container to the value of the DISPLAY variable on the host machine. 
This is required for GUI applications to connect to the X11 server.

"-p 8000:8000": Maps port 8000 on the host machine to port 8000 inside the container. 
This allows accessing services running inside the container on port 8000 from the host machine.

"7b56a2c6b724": Specifies the ID or name of the Docker image to use for creating the container. 
In this case, the image ID of the "ros:noetic" image is "7b56a2c6b724".
to check the image that you have localy type "docker images"

5- Navigate to the directory that contains the app. ex: "cd Desktop/rosbags/"

6- run the following command to instal pip.
"sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-pip"

7- Install uvicorn,fastapi,jinja2,python-multipart using: "pip install uvicorn fastapi jinja2 python-multipart"

8- run the following command to launch the application: "uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000"
"uvicorn": It is the command to run the Uvicorn server.
"main:app": It specifies the Python module (main) and the instance of the FastAPI application (app) to run.
"--host 0.0.0.0": It sets the host IP address to 0.0.0.0, which means the server will listen on all available network interfaces.
"--port 8000": It sets the port number to 8000, specifying the network port where the server will listen for incoming connections.

9- Open any browser and navigate to 127.0.0.1:8000.

Congrats! You're ready to use the app.

Additional Information:

To stop the application go to the terminal and click "Ctrl-C"

To stop the docker container type "exit" to exit the container and to go to the main directory then execute the following command: "docker stop fastapi_app"
"display_rosbag" is the name of the docker container. You can use the docker ID instead of it's name.

To display the details of containers in Docker, you can use the "docker ps" command like:
"docker ps": Lists the running containers.
"docker ps -a": Lists all containers, including the stopped ones.
